I am writing to express my interest in the Senior UX Engineer position at El Toro. With nearly a decade of experience in UX and front-end development, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your team, and facilitate others to deliver exceptional user experiences.

I prioritize the user's perspective throughout the design process, ensuring that products are intuitive, accessible, and meet their needs while balancing company goals. I also have experience with advocating for excellent user experience within the company across all teams. By understanding the goals and objectives of various stakeholders, I can demonstrate how investing in UX directly aligns with their own needs, resulting in improved outcomes for the business as a whole.

I have a firm grasp on design tools such as Adobe Creative Suite, and am currently learning Figma. I possess a strong command of frontend technologies, including JavaScript, CSS (Sass and Less preprocessors), Bootstrap, build tools, Node, NPM, and Git via command line. I also have hands-on experience with frameworks such as React, React Native, and Angular, and I am quick to learn and adapt to new technologies and tools.

I have first-hand experience leading the creation of a design system that is utilized by multiple software-as-a-service apps across web and mobile. In this role, I focused on creating a bootstrap theme comprised of reusable components. Additionally, I documented the system with examples of actual use in our apps to establish a single source of truth. This enabled developers to seamlessly transition from a rough Balsamiq mockup provided by a product owner to a fully functional app or page in a timely manner.

What sets me apart is my ability to communicate ideas and concepts effectively with team members, regardless of their technical knowledge. I can communicate effectively and translate goals and technical details with anyone from leadership, product managers, product owners, design team members, and developers to ensure efficient and effective work gets done.

From talking with Francesca this position feels like the logical next step for my career and I was very excited to hear how perfectly it seems to line up with what I have done and am passionate about.

Thanks for your time,

Alex Bezuska
