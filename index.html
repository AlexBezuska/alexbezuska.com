          I am a UX/UI Designer, Front End Developer, and Indie Game Developer with a passion for when art and technology work together for a purpose. As a transplant to Louisville from Orange County, CA, I have discovered the extraordinary beauty of all four seasons and life without a great deal of traffic.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that design is much more than a coat of paint. Design and user experience must create a seamless flow from the creator to the user in order to clearly convey the website's message. I am excited about working in environments that understand the importance and advantages of technology and encourages their team to learn and experiment with new web practices.

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>

        <h3>Web Developer | cafepress</h3>
        <em>May 2014 - Present</em>
        <p> 
          I started my career at cafepress on a small "labs" team focussed on creating new and exciting products and the web experiences to get those products in front of customers. Since then I have moved to the front end team on the main cafepress website, where I manage pages seen by tens of thousands of users a day. I primarily work in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
        </p> 

        <h3>Front End Web Developer | Mortenson Dental Partners</h3>
        <em>April 2013 - May 2014</em>
        <p>
          I designed and developed internal use web apps and internal/external websites.  While I specialized in the design and UI/UX of each project, I also gained a lot of usefull experience with C#, SQL server. I was the UX watchdog on the team, and faught for the users in any way I could.  
        </p> 

        <h3>Independent Web Designer | Alexbezuska.com</h3>
        <em>January 2008 - April 2013</em>
        <p>
          Worked one-on-one with clients to bring their vision and purpose to life on each custom website.  To do this I worked to balance the end user’s needs and the client’s requests.

        <h2>Personal Experience</h2>

        <h3>Creator/Designer/Artist |  <a href="http://twoscoopgames.com" target="_blank">Two Scoop Games</a></h3>
        <em>November 2013 - Present</em>  
        <p>
          To keep my skills current and to sustain my passion for design and programming, a friend and I develop HTML5/JavaScript games.  We have currently completed nine projects, all of which are cross-platform, three of which are on the iOS app store.  We also take on contract game development work for businesses and organizations. In doing this I am able to combine my passions for art and technology to create games for all to enjoy.
        </p>

        <h3>Organizer/Host | <a href="http://jslou.org" target="_blank">Game Dev lou </a></h3>
        <em>Feburary 2014 - Present</em>
        <p>
          The independant game developer community in Louisville is a huge passion of mine. I organize meetings, events, game jams (think hack-a-thons), and much more. Our group is currently in the process of acquiring it's own building and providing an education program for kids and co-working space for the community.
        </p>


        <h3>Founder/Organizer/Host | <a href="http://jslou.org" target="_blank">JSLou </a></h3>
        <em>August 2013 - Present</em>
        <p>
          In order to grow and challenge myself as a developer I have started and sustained JSLou, a local group focused on all things JavaScript. I have learned a great deal from the many experienced developers I have met through JSLou. I enjoy facilitating an environment where others can learn and expand their skills.
