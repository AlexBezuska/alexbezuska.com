<p>So this one might take some explaining... a few months back I had the idea to work on a small game as a sort of interactive birthday card for my dad, the idea for the game comes from a story he told me about a game him and some friends created when he was a kid. My dad grew up in Brooklyn in the 60&#39;s and didn&#39;t have much, he and his friend Mario would visit the junk yard and find random things to make stuff out of or play with, and one that always stuck out to me because of how ridiculous it sounded was HickoryStock. <img alt="Alex Bezuska Indie Game Dev HickoryStock " src="/images/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-06-at-2.34.33-AM.png"/>The game is played by trying to fling a high-heeled shoe filled with cement into a hole in a wall using an umbrella. If that wasn&#39;t bad enough they suckered a kid at school into playing as the goalie... not sure how they convinced this kid...</p>

<p>So here is the game, the basic idea is get the shoe through the hole, but each time the hole moves randomly to make things a little more tough. On the title screen I included a character my dad used to draw and threw in lots of misspellings because my dad&#39;s bad spelling is an inside-joke in our family.</p>

<p>I showed him the game on his birthday and he loved it. I am glad that even if nobody ever really plays it - I got some good practice making games, and had a chance to make something our family can laugh about.</p>

<p>Here is a video of the game in action:</p>
