          <h2 class="blog-post-title">Are Your Strong Software Opinions Adding to GameDev Community Gatekeeping?</h2>
          <p class="blog-post-meta">June 10th, 2018  8:00 pm</p>
          <p>I started writing this back in April and I was a little afraid to post it, but I still feel this is an issue worth talking about and I am going to post it now.</p>

<p>It’s really hard for me to write an article criticizing something that both my friends and myself are totally guilty of, but I feel like it needs to be addressed.
Walk into any tech related event or meetup and I guarantee you will hear someone’s opinion about how some OS/language/software is superior or inferior to something else.</p>

<p>I want to take a second to define <strong>gatekeeping</strong>
I really like this definition of <strong>gatekeeping</strong> I found on Urban Dictionary</p>

<p><strong>Gatekeeping</strong></p>

<p>&quot;When someone takes it upon themselves to decide who does or does not have access or rights to a community or identity.&quot;</p>

<p>source: <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Gatekeeping">Urban Dictionary - Gatekeeping</a></p>

<p>Coming into the the tech community and meeting people who have been programming longer than I have means I have always been around these debates. I have never really understood them but I have also found myself slipping into picking teams. I’m guilty of this and I want to do better. I have things I like and things I don’t but here is why I am going to try to keep my sweeping statements and absolute opinions to myself: <em>I thought about how new people might interpret them.</em></p>

<p>Join me in taking a couple of minutes to think of how these conversations and debates might come off to someone new.</p>

<h4>Imagine this scenario</h4>

<p>A new person comes to a meeting where people will be working on and talking about game creation; their laptop runs operating system X and they have just barely started working on a game with game engine Y. During the meeting they overhear somebody trashing one of these things because of some &quot;super important&quot; strong opinion.</p>

<h4>Let’s think about some possible outcomes:</h4>

<p>The new person...</p>

<ol><li>hears the opinions and does not care because they are somehow confident in their chosen tool even though they are new at making games.</li><li>hears this and also has strong opinion about tools and chimes in creating further unnecessary antagonism.</li><li>starts to second-guess the project that they’re working on or question whether or not what they are doing is valid.</li><li>stops what they’re doing completely until they can “do it the right way” ( this sounds extreme but I have heard multiple stories of this happening)</li></ol>

<p>Do you think this is creates a welcoming environment for new people or contributes to further gatekeeping of an already presumed (and somewhat rightfully so) extremely difficult hobby/career path?</p>

<h4>More questions to ask ourselves</h4>

<p>What if the new person can only afford tool X or has invested a ton of time into learning it?</p>

<p>When someone who isn’t a game developer plays a game do you think they care if it was made with unity, or game maker, RPG maker, flash or a completely custom engine?</p>

<h4>Counterpoint</h4>

<p>One argument against this I can think of is a good-natured desire to help a new person with suggestions of a tool that might fit their needs, be easier for them, or better suited for the task at hand. This is fine, I am not suggesting we don&#39;t talk about what we enjoy using, but there are good and bad ways to offer these suggestions. Unsolicited advice can really make people feel small.</p>

<p>&quot;I had a similar problem and I solved it using ...&quot; comes off much better than &quot;You should use...&quot; or &quot;Why are you doing it that way?&quot;</p>

<h4>Thoughts</h4>

<p>In the game development community which I am a part of and specifically the local scene I help to organize and foster we already have a lot of stigmas to get over.</p>

<p>While this issue is surely less important than creating a welcoming and inclusive community for people of all regardless of identity, background, or ability, I feel like it still can contribute to a similar dynamic of people being made to feel like there are “outsiders” and “insiders” within the group.</p>

<p>I want to work toward a community where we can all be happy that people are making cool art. I want to work toward a community that cares less about weather or not the tool they used to create it was the &quot;right one&quot; because maybe it was the exactly the &quot;right one&quot; for them.
We have agreed that we want to work toward diversity in the people who feel they can make games, let&#39;s also be accepting of a diversity in the tools and tech they use.</p>
