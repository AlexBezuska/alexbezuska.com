The goal of LMG is to provide educational courses and promote game development careers in the city of Louisville, KY. In February 2016, we had the grand opening for Warp Zone Louisville, the first and only game development-centric co-working space in Lousiville (and Kentucky!).

            <p class="mb-15">In order to grow and challenge myself as a developer, I founded and hosted JSLou; a local group focused on all things JavaScript. I have learned a great deal from the many experienced developers I have met through JSLou. I enjoyed facilitating an environment where others can learn and expand their skills. After maintaining the group for nearly 5 years I passed the torch to new passionate developers to continue facilitating the community.</p>
