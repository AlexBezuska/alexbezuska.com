	<h1>Refine</h1><h2>Hands and Feet</h2>
	<p class=" justify">Video I created to promote a small non-profit organization here in Louisville. The video follows a young person who is part of the Refine community, intentionally making time for - and serving others though their everyday life. I had a blast making this and had the opportunity to work with great people while doing so. My wife and I filmed in several fun locations such as the Louisville waterfront in the height of kite season, and <a href="https://sunergoscoffee.com/" target="_blank"> Sunergos coffee</a> who was very accommodating and even gave us some free Chai! <br/>

	<h1>It is Growing...</h1>
	<h2> (Documentary clip)</h2>
	<p class="justify">
		Here is a cut from my 25min documentary about a small non-profit in southern California who works with people experiencing homelessness.While volunteering for around 2 years with Micah's Way we were blessed with the opportunity to spend time with many great people from many cultures, backgrounds, and philosophies - all of which came together for a common purpose - to provide what help and company we could to the people we met each day. I love the process of interviewing, and making people comfortable in front of the camera is key. Keeping a good conversation going really helps - improvisation and catching people with a question they don't expect usually led to the best results and a good laugh for everyone involved.
