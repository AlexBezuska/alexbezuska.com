Welcome to my website! ... well the git repo for it anyway! Wow you're a nerd aren't you? No problem, I am into some pretty nerdy stuff too like making video games!

More to come... when I feel like it.


## How it works

This site uses a custom static site and blog generator(thats some nerdy shit isn't it?)

### To build:

1. run `npm start` from the terminal, then files will magically appear in the `dest` folder.


### To preview it

Run `npm run serve` and it will do a python thing and let you view the site at port 8000


### Now you need to get those files onto a server.

'npm run upload'
