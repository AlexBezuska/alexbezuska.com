Welcome to my website! ... well the git repo for it anyway! Wow you're a nerd aren't you? No problem, I am into some pretty nerdy stuff too like making video games!

More to come... when I feel like it.



## Bugs

- logo missing on firefox
- fonts are extremely thin in firefox/ubuntu
- embedded youtube videos dont work
```
Code for when I get around to fixing this:

```




## To build:

1. run `npm start` from the terminal, then files will magically appear in the `dest` folder.


### To preview it

Run `npm run serve` and it will do a python thing and let you view the site at port 8000


### Now you need to get those files onto a server.

'npm run upload'
