I have been working on a new logo and animation for Kick Bot DX. I created the sprites and animation frames in photoshop and did the animation/ particles in Unity.

See it in action:

Behind the scenes. Here are the sprites I created in Photoshop, there are multiple frames for metal warping out when the robot head is smashing through, and also when and LCD screen is flipping up. Contrast and perspective in the art, and scale in the animation are used together to create the illusion of depth.  Overall I am pretty happy with how this has turned out, I had the idea to animate the logo in this way since we first started on the game.

### What's next?

Next we need to create a system to swap the head out for the head the player currently has equipped. I think this will add a bit more fun to the game.
