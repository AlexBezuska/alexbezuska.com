In my ongoing practice to improve at the free 3D modeling software Blender I created a digital birthday card for Cara featuring a low-poly 3D mandolin. During this project I learned how to add materials (solid colors in my case) to individual faces on an object. Lighting is my biggest weakness, I barely understand it at all. I know the exact look I am going for but need a lot more practice with the lights.
