Try it yourself, using the working demo: [squid.alexbezuska.com](http://squid.alexbezuska.com/)
The idea at this point is if you hit an enemy you start the level over, it's not about fighting enemies, but instead collecting items and navigating to a goal.
The plan is to have moving pattern based obstacles like this Horseshoe Crab, and also stationary ones like sharp coral or pits not sure quite yet...

The next big goal is to have a goal, a way to beat the level even if its just a flag at the end.
