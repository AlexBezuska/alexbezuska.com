Not much here But I got the first stage started! I am using an app called Tiled (Mac or Windows) which is a general purpose map editor that allows for some pretty awesome stuff such as layers and makes setting up the collision detection with MelonJS pretty easy.

Check out Tiled here: [http://www.mapeditor.org/](http://www.mapeditor.org/)

and MelonJS here: [http://www.melonjs.org/](http://www.melonjs.org/)
