Okay so, here's where I'm at with the squid game.

![](/images/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-04-at-12.00.00-AM.png)I have added and have been working on a debug level where I will try out different physics stuff, objects, terrain types, and eventually enemies.
One of my friends had a cool suggestion that though the course of the game you upgrade your bed to a full, queen and eventually king size, seems like the perfect nonsense for the game!
