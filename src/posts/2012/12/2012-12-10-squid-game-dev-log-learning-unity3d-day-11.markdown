**Day 11 - 12-10-12**
So-far so Good, I have now figured out how to have the player 'eat' the caffeine pills and boost the awake meter by 25pts and have the pill object disappear
- Fun stuff, most of the game mechanics are done, as this is a simple game.



	
  * Movement - **Done**

	
  * Collection of itemsÂ  and positive effects - **Done**

	
  * Rock rolling ability - **Somewhat Done**

	
  * Enemies and negative effects -** Not Started**

	
  * Endpoints, and level switching - **Not Started**

	
  * Saving and continuing from where you left off - **Not Started**

	
  * Menus - **Still needs to be done**

	
  * fix rock dynamics - **Needs to be done**
