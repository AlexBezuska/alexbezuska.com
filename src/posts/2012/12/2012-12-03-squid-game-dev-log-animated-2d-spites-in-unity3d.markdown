After  spending about 5 hours total trying to figure 2d sprite animation AND keyboard controls in Unity, I think I finally have a decent workflow setup... - its also my birthday today!

I am using a free add-on called [Orthello ](http://www.wyrmtale.com/products/unity3d-components/orthello)(WyrmTale Games) which has several great components for handling animated sprites, and a free app called [Texture Packer](http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker) (Code'n'Web - Mac, PC, Linux) to  create sprite sheets. Texture Packer generates an xml file that Orthello can read to map the sprites and give them unique numbers - which makes it easy to choose what frames go to what animation.

There was a bit of a learning curve, but I feel like I am much farther along, even though the end result is not as complete as my javascript browser version.

Here are a couple screens!![](/images/2012/12/photo.jpg)![](/images/2012/12/Debug_world.unity_-_new-ver_-_PC_Mac___Linux_Standalone-20121202-212929.jpg.jpg)
