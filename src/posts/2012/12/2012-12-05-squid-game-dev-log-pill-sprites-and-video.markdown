Awesome things:

Using Orthello to achieve 2d sprite animation in Unity3D I found a cool setting called "Start on random frame" on the Animating Sprite which allows me to have my pill spites rotate independently - which adds a cool little visual.

I set the z axis (depth) to different amounts for each seaweed, and some are jostles more or not at all depending on the depth relative to the player.

I am obsessing over tiny details, but really fun!
Unity3d is crazy on options.
