I was not planning on participating in [this April's Ludum Dare Game Jam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38) because I, along with several people from [Louisville Makes Games](http://louisvillemakesgames.org) (our local Louisville KY game dev community) were attending and speaking at [Vector](http://vectorconf.com), a local conference similar to [GDC](http://www.gdconf.com/) but on a much smaller scale.

I really liked the theme "A Small World" and came up with the concept of a simple sealed terrarium where the plants grow and die in a constantly repeating cycle. I talked with Cara Smith about the concept and she was interested and started doing the artwork.

I programmed the game using no engine just JavaScript with [PixiJS](http://www.pixijs.com/) to handle the rendering.

I wrote a small story with Cara's help with proofreading and suggestions. The story is about my struggles with depression and anxiety. It was interesting channeling the feelings I have when I am depressed because when writing the story I was not depressed. I feel like people, especially those in the game development community, talking openly about mental health issues has helped me a lot with my own. I want to write more and try making more narrative-based games, and work on my writing and storytelling.

While this is not really a game or very interactive, I wanted to put out what we created and call it finished.

The game will only work on a computer in the browser with keyboard for controls.

There is not much interaction, just use **right arrow** key to advance the story, **left arrow** key to go back.
