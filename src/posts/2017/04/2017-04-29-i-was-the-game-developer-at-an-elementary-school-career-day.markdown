I recently had the opportunity to speak at an elementary school career day to groups of kindergarten through 5th grade students about my career in game development.
The kids were super fun, they all loved talking about which video games they liked to play and could have gone on all day if we had the time. I ended up giving the same presentation around 15 times to groups of 5 or 6 kids at a time.

I have a few insights below from the questions I asked them and the most common questions they asked me.

### Questions the kids asked me:
- How long have you been making games?
- What is your favorite game that you've made?
- Is programming hard?
- What is your most popular game?
- Are your games on the app store?
- What is the weirdest game you have made?

### Questions I asked the kids:

- "What games do you like to play?"  
(answers in order of most to least)

  1. Minecraft

  2. Call of Duty

  3. Grand Theft Auto

  4. Paper Mario: Color Splash


Mentioned once each:
Five Nights at Freddy's, Crossy Road, Pac Man



- "What do you play games on?"
(answers in order of most to least)

  1. Phone

  2. Xbox

  3. PS4


- What game developers do you know of?
(answers in order of most to least)

  1. Mojang (Minecraft)


  2. Microsoft


Mentioned once each:
Activision, Jeb (Minecraft), Scott Cawthon (Five Nights at Freddy's), Gamestop, "My dad", "I made a game", "You", and "Alex"


One of my favorite career day take-aways was seeing a kid's face light up when he saw Kick Bot in my Two Scoop Games demo reel video. He shouted, "You made kick bot, I've seen that! I saw a YouTuber play that game! You made that?!"



And now to close out I have some great resources for learning to make games!
