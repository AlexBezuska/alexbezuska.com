A potential client with a large game project came to us, larger than we could handle alone in the timeframe they wanted. I reached out to several other game developers in our local Louisville Makes Games community to form a super-team. We worked togheter for about a week, creating a proposal for the client's project, but we decided to take it one step further and create an example game that introduced each member of the team, talked a bit about our skills and strengths and exhibited what we are capable of with our combined experience.

The result is "The Underdogs", a small interactive introduction created using Unity.
My portion of the project was character design and animation as well as helping to manage the team and create the written proposal document.
While the client ended up not being able to secure funding for the project, everyone on our Underdogs team learned valuable practical skills in both game development and business.
I concider the project a success.

Team:
Alex Bezuska, Allen Brower, Josh Grilli, Eric Lathrop, Loi Le, and Barry Rowe
