Kick Bot Dev Log July 5th, 2017
-Alex Bezuska

On July 4th a group of game creators in the [Louisville Makes Games](http://louisvillemakesgames.org/) community decided to do an impromptu “Indie-pendence day”. We hung out at [Warp Zone Louisville](http://louisvillemakesgames.org/warpzone/) all day and jammed on our projects for Kentucky Fried Pixels (game jam that will end next weekend on July 9th).
I put [Summer Games Done Quick](https://gamesdonequick.com/) on the projector and hung out with Barry, Loi, Josh, and Allen and worked on a ton of art for Kick Bot DX.

I have had a bit of a block on the new character designs Kick Bot so I worked on updates for the existing art including backgrounds, walls, hazards, and the classic Kick Bot character. I found that creating a mockup of a game screenshot in Photoshop really helped me see how everything would look together.

I imported the existing Kick Bot artwork, laid out a mock screenshot, and doubled the pixel size of everything. My goal was to add more detail while still retaining quick readability of all elements in the game. The other concern was keeping the exact sizes of all game elements while upping the detail. I did this by making the new sprites exactly 200% the size of the original giving me twice as many pixels of detail to work with and setting the “Pixels Per Unit” for the changed sprites to 2 instead of 1 as they were before.(this setting is specific to our game)

Below are some screenshots of the new artwork:

I use Adobe Photoshop for all of my pixel art.

Kick Bot DX is being created for the Kentucky Fried Pixels (KFP) game jam which ends July 9th, we will be releasing a pay-what-you-want bundle of games on August 17th!
