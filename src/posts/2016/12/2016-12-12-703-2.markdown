Ludum Dare might be an odd title,  
heck folks even argue over it's recital…  
<br/>

But if you get your thrills stretching yourself and learning new skills  
this concept should be nothing foreign  
<br/>

With two variations,  
the "compo" my persuasion,  
I set off on my two day task..
<br/>

As the rules state:  
- Make a game in a weekend,  
no help from a mate.  
- All original art, code, and sound,  
Nothing borrowed or found.
<br/>

Long nights and stretched days  
in a caffeine haze  
I worked till my Wacom grew weary.
<br/>

Keeping things concise and tame  
allowed me to finish within the allotted time frame.
<br/>

The lead in this tale   
...whom despite being a snail,  
I believe many of us can relate.
<br/>

A story about how comparison can be dreadful and everything uncertain   
- unless you have friends who can pull back your curtain…
<br/>

Try my game today,   
and don't fear you won't be able to play…
<br/>

No past game skills or fast paced thrills, anyone with a computer can play!
