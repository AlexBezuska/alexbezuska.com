Ludum Dare might be an odd title,   

heck folks even argue over it's recital…





But if you get your thrills stretching yourself and learning new skills   

this concept should be nothing foreign 





With two variations,   

the "compo" my persuasion,   

I set off on my two day task..





As the rules state:   

- Make a game in a weekend,   

no help from a mate.  

- All original art, code, and sound,   

Nothing borrowed or found.





Long nights and stretched days  

in a caffeine haze   

I worked till my Wacom grew weary.





Keeping things concise and tame  

allowed me to finish within the allotted time frame.





The lead in this tale   

…whom despite being a snail,   

I believe many of us can relate.





A story about how comparison can be dreadful and everything uncertain   

- unless you have friends who can pull back your curtain…





Try my game today,   

and don't fear you won't be able to play…





No past game skills or fast paced thrills, anyone with a computer can play!
