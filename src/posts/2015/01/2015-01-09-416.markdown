[Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.com) is this month!




I designed an image for custom #GGJ15 buttons! Feel free to use the image to make your own, let me know if you need a higher-res copy, or anything else.




We here at [Two Scoop Games](http://twoscoopgames.com) are excited to participate in our second Global Game Jam!  
  
You can also order the buttons from CafePress (my work) here: [http://www.cafepress.com/+global_game_jam_button_225_button_10_pack,1484318708](http://www.cafepress.com/+global_game_jam_button_225_button_10_pack,1484318708)
