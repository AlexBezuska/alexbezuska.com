So Inspired by my buddy Bill, [Ill Storms](https://soundcloud.com/klownikus), a musician who does an electronic track every week, and another musician [Jonathan Mann](https://twitter.com/songadaymann) who does a song a day, I have decided to do a challenge this year where I post one piece of art a day created in 20 minutes or less.

I also want to do a challenge where once a week I do a face drawing, and a drawing of hands , since these are things I need to improve on.

it will end up being:

**360 daily drawings**
**52 heads**
**52 hands**

by the end of this year.

Wish me luck!
