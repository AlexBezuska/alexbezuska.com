Not just any new version, but the first public release of the new Splat which we are calling **[Splat ECS](https://github.com/SplatJS/splat-ecs)**. ECS stands for [Entity Component System ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system), a design the new Splat is based on. The new version is a completely different way of making games so there is a new Github repo, new name, and I designed a new logo for it as well.
