![blog-louisville-business-first](/images/2015/10/blog-louisville-business-first.jpg)Recently I was contacted by David at Louisville Business First about coming in for an interview about our new project Louisville Makes Games!
David was introduced to Eric and I at the Louisville Mini Maker Faire last month and was interested in what our non-profit is doing and homes to do for the city.

Eric and I met up with David at Business First Louisville's offices downtown and talked about everything from our day jobs, to Two Scoop Games, and then about Louisville Makes Games! and our plans for Warp Zone, a game dev co-working and education space. We talked about how the directors and members want the space setup Louisville as a beacon for game dev careers and allow for a community highlighted by unique storytelling and diversity.

You can [check out the full article here](http://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/news/2015/10/14/nonprofit-seeks-to-open-louisvilles-only-game.html), and be sure to share it as it's popularity will create incentive to continue covering the game dev scene here in Louisville.
