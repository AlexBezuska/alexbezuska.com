###  5:00pm - 3:00am | +8 Hours Dev Time | 8 Hours Total Dev Time 



So you may or may not have seen on the rbmlb twitter that rbmlb is now 2 people!  Anthony @datGamerDood has joined forces  and we plan to release our first game by the year 20XX!

Last-night was our first game jam night, and it lasted about  8 hours, during that time whiteboards were doodled upon, graphics were drawn, and I believe even  several(approx.) lines of code were written!

We are excited to start our first game which will be titled "Balloon Chase Vehicle" which as of now will run on Win/Mac.
Here are some relevant photos:
