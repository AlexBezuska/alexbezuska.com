Hi my name is Alex, and I'm a CSS addict.

I have been a freelance UX /Web Designer for about 6 years, and just recently - started a full-time job working as the web designer for a great local company. I have a love for HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript, and I recently took the dive into Sass, which is purely rad-tastic.

I hope to learn more about Wordpress, jQuery, NODE.js, Backbone.js, and Compass!

That's where this blog comes in, my hope is to share the new things I learn with hopes to teach others who are trying to learn the same things as I am.

Well , I'm off to work. - but check back here and see what I'm up-to, or follow me on twitter [@alexbezuska](http://twitter.com/alexbezuska)!
