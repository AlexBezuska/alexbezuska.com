Have you ever been working on a client's website and notice that the logo is not clickable?
Sometimes you may find someone embedded the logo into the header as one large image, and therefore when a user goes to intuitively click the logo to return home, nothing happens - this is bad usability.

Here is a quick and easy fix for that, with an added bonus of making the logo text readable in screen-readers for the visually impaired.

I'm sure I'm not the first to think of this, but I hope it helps someone who find themselves in the same situation. Please let me know if you have a better method, as I am always hoping to improve. Have a great day!
