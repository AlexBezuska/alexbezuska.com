You might just edit the 'style.css' file or equivalent - or you might go straight for the jugular and strip out all the html leaving only the relevant tags the CMS uses to fill in dynamic content, then add in your own markup around them. This is what I did when learning Drupal, and now that I am working with Wordpress I started down the same path for a couple of client sites - but now I have found a real gem for any WP theming beginners out there and that gem is underscores.

A completely blank theme agnostic to any design direction to give you a blank canvas to work your creative magic however you want. No pre-supposed boundaries or grids, just a clean slate.

I really dont know what else to say - its exactly where you should start as a WP themer - and its open source and being refined and updates all the time via the GitHub repository.

And let me know how it worked out for you.
