### New Indie Game project!


Scurry is an HTML5 browser game where you play as a beetle who is running through a grocery store. Run as fast as you can, pull off daring jumps, avoid shoppers, roach motels and other treacherous obstacles! How far will you make it?


Here is what Scurry looked like right after Eric added in my character sprite:

The project is a two-person team effort; Eric Lathrop is doing the code, and I am working the artwork.

We just met up at a coffee shop for our first session and got a lot done, I am very happy with how it is turning out so far.

Here is a shot of the game with some shelf art and grocery store props added:

I have some videos below that show the progress taking Eric's engine and adding in the art assets I have been creating. Eric is working on generating infinite levels using repeating and randomized artwork, resulting in a new experience for the player each time.
