### 7:30pm - 1:00am | +5.5 Hours Dev Time | 28.75 Hours Total Dev Time




## Highlights:


Today was a good day, we got a lot done that we can be proud of. Being new to Unity, it took a while for some things to 'click,' and this night a lot of things did.
Starting with a working mock-up I (Alex) created, Anthony was able to jump off from that point and get the engine going. It did take some re-writing, and a lot of adjustments in Unity to get the '2.5d that looks like 2d' working right.
