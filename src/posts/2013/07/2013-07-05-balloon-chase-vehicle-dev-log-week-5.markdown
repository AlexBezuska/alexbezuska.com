##  Collisions!





The main focus of this night was getting collisions and jumping working, and we got somewhere. I would by no means call it perfect, but we have a goo starting point for collisions and jumping. and also some weird errors..





Overall a good night and I can see the momentum building now, so we can get going on level design once the engine is basically figured out.
