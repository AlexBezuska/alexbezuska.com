In the [SplatJS blank project](https://github.com/SplatJS/blank-splatjs-project), learn what the 'npm run build' command does, what script it is running, and see if I can modify it to add my own stuff to it.
I want to see if I can integrate my rsnyc upload shell scripts so I can upload the project to my experiments section on my site as I make changes.
