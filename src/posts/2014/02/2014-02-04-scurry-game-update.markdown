So it has been a while since I have posted any news about the game that Eric and I are working on. Scurry is coming along great and I have lots to show.

We have added a title screen, complete with twitching antennae.

Here are a few shots of gameplay:

A lot of the work has been Eric getting everything setup to scale and fit any screen size properly, detect desktop or mobile browsers, and have working audio on many devices.

I on the other hand have been working on the artwork and animations, I am excited about how it is all turning out, and we have a roadmap for completing the game with two types of levels and 4 levels total. It will feel really good to finish off our first real game.
