Cara, Eric, Allen, and I met up at Dish for breakfast then headed to Warp Zone to work on cleaning up the space and taking inventory. We got rid of a lot and came up with a cataloging system for laptops, monitors, headsets and more. Loi dropped by later and helped too. This was a huge improvement to our organization in the space! Great work!
