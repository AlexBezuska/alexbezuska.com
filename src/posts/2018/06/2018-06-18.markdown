Worked on this early concept art for the map view in a game project I am working on with [Two Scoop Games](http://twoscoopgames.com).

We have not decided on an art style yet but it was helpful to lay elements out on a phone mockup and see how it felt. If we don't end up going in this direction I might refine the buildings and add more color variants to make a cartoon building sprites Unity asset pack.
