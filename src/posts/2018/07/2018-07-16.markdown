##### Kick Bot DX part store is now powered by our new shop service

Every time a player accesses the shop screen in the game it makes a call to our new shop service.

The shop service is powered by AWS lambda and it seeds a random number generator with the current date and then picks a random part from each category (heads, arms, legs, etc.). As long as the date is the same, it returns the same parts, creating a dynamic shop with different parts available each day.

##### Same daily parts for all players

The shop inventory for each day is generated by the shop service, so it's the same result for everyone no-matter what time zone they are using the app in, or what they have their device time set to - resulting in the whole world seeing the same parts available at any given time.

Eventually, we'll want to change it to use a shuffling algorithm so it's guaranteed to pick every part at least once.
