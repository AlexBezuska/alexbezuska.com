We created a new game for Global Game Jam 2018!
The theme was "Transmission" and we came up with a game based on transmission of genetics from one generation to another. I was inspired by Evo: Search for Eden on the Super Nintendo.

In Fineage you transmit characteristics of your fish to your descendants on each play-through.
