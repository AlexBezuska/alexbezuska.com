            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am a Game Developer, UX/UI Designer, and JavaScript Developer with a passion for when art and technology work together for a purpose.</p>
            <p>I believe that design is much more than a coat of paint. Design and user experience must create a seamless flow from the creator to the user in order to clearly convey the intended message.</p>
            <p>I am a web &amp; game developer and advocate. I organize meetups, create events, and help direct a non-profit to promote and advance the Louisville tech scene and ensure viable and relevant technology careers in our city.</p>
            <p>I believe that technology, but more specifically code literacy, is hugely important to our collective future and I strive to help further programming education in Louisville.</p>
            <p>Please take some time to read about my experience and feel free to contact me with any questions.</p>

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>

            <h3>Creator/Designer/Artist |  <a href="http://twoscoopgames.com" target="_blank">Two Scoop Games</a></h3>
            <em>November 2013 &ndash; Present</em>
            <p>
              To keep my skills current and to sustain my passion for designing and programming, my business partner and I develop web and mobile games. In doing this I am able to combine my passion for art and technology to create games for all to enjoy. We have currently completed 3 full releases on online app stores, and 12 game prototypes. We also take on contract game development work for businesses and organizations as <a href="http://twoscoopinteractive.com">Two Scoop Interactive</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>UX Engineer | Platform Q</h3>
            <em>Jan 2015 &ndash; Jan 2018</em>
            <p>
              At Platform Q I worked to translate wireframes, mockups, and prototypes into intuitive user experiences. I worked remotely with a team of talented developers to implement designs and features for a highly profitable online video learning platform. I worked with two teams and maintained daily communication. I worked with technologies including Wordpress, Angular 4, JavaScript, and CSS / SASS.
            </p>

            <h3>Web Developer | cafepress</h3>
            <em>May 2014 &ndash; Dec 2015</em>
            <p>
              I started my career at cafepress on a small labs team focused on creating new and exciting products and the web experiences to get those products in front of customers. Since then I have moved to the front end team on the main cafepress website, where I manage pages seen by tens of thousands of users a day. I primarily work in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
            </p>

            <!-- <h3>Front End Web Developer | Mortenson Dental Partners</h3>
            <em>April 2013 &ndash; May 2014</em>
            <p>
              I designed and developed internal use web apps and internal/external websites. While I specialized in the design and UI/UX of each project, I also gained a lot of useful experience with C# and SQL. I was the UX watchdog on the team, and fought for the users in any way I could.
            </p>

            <h3>Independent Web Designer | AlexBezuska.com</h3>
            <em>January 2008 &ndash; April 2013</em>
            <p>
              I worked one-on-one with clients to bring their vision and purpose to life on each custom website. To do this I worked to balance the end user’s needs and the client’s requests.

            <h2>Community Development Experience</h2>
            <h3>Founder/Director | <a href="http://louisvillemakesgames.org" target="_blank">Louisville Makes Games, Inc.</a></h3>
            <em>Aug 2015 &ndash; Present</em>
            <p>
              In 2015 I co-founded a 501-(c)(3) non-profit organization called Louisville Makes Games, Inc. The goal of LMG is to provide educational courses and promote game development careers in the city of Louisville, KY. In February 2016, we had the grand opening for Warp Zone Louisville, the first and only game development-centric co-working space in Lousiville (and Kentucky!). We run meetups, classes, and events out of Warp Zone as well as providing the ammenities of a co-working space on Main Street in downtown Louisville.
            </p>

            <h3>Organizer/Host | <a href="https://www.meetup.com/LouisvilleMakesGames/" target="_blank">Lousville Game Creator's Meetup </a></h3>
            <em>February 2014 &ndash; Present</em>
            <p>
              The independent game developer community in Louisville is a huge passion of mine. The Lousville Game Creator's Meetup (formerly Game Dev Lou) is a twice-monthly meetup and support group for local game developers. I have facilitated nearly every meeting, and to date I have helped to organize 3-4 game jam events per year.
            </p>

            <h3>Founder/Organizer/Host | <a href="http://jslou.org" target="_blank">JSLou </a></h3>
            <em>August 2013 &ndash; Present</em>
            <p>
              In order to grow and challenge myself as a developer, I have started and sustained JSLou; a local group focused on all things JavaScript. I have learned a great deal from the many experienced developers I have met through JSLou. I enjoy facilitating an environment where others can learn and expand their skills.

            <h2>Teaching</h2>
            <p>In 2017 I had a major role in the development and teaching of a free 6-week summer program at Warp Zone Louisville to give kids a taste of the many disciplines of game development including; coding, story, art &amp; animation, music &amp; sound, and game design. In 2014 I taught a monthly game development workshop at Velocity Indiana, a co-working space, for youth ages 11-18 as part of their code education program.</p>
